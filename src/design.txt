!feller inhouse command
    -ping @here?
    -wait for 10 user reactions (11 total, add own reaction. If there's a way to make command sender react automatically use that)
    -get each user's connections: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-user-connections
        -loop through all, look for league
        -those that have it, get username (same link as above)
        -determine total number that have it, number to sort per team is half that. number for other team is total-half (avoids odd nu,ber issue)
        -look up username in riot api via summoner name: https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#summoner-v4/GET_getBySummonerName
        -grab accountID from that
        -look up rank via accountID: https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#league-v4/GET_getLeagueEntriesForSummoner
        -loop through returned set and find queueType of solo
        -Get rank/tier from that entry in set
        -assign numerical weight value based on tier
            -0 for iron, 10 for bronze, 20 for silver, etc... 80 for master, 90 for gm, 100 for chally
            -add to that 10-number of tier (e.g. 6 for tier 4)
            -Example: an iron 3 player would have a weight of 7, a gold 2 would have a weight of 38, a challenger will always have a weight of 109
        -sort from highest to lowest on each team, pickinging randomly if theres a tie. Eg highest to team 1, next highest to team 2, and so on.
        -put into chat the two sorted teams
        -tag users who dont have league linked and ask them to?
